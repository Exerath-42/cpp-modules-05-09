# C++ Modules 05-09

Welcome to the C++ Learning Modules project! The goal of these modules is to introduce you to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using the C++ programming language. This project marks the starting point of your C++ journey, and it's designed to provide a solid foundation in OOP concepts.

## Introduction

Many programming languages recommend learning OOP, and we have chosen C++ for this purpose. C++ is a natural choice because it inherits much of its syntax and features from C, making it familiar to those who are already experienced with C. However, please note that we will be adhering to the C++98 standard in this project to keep things simple and focused on core OOP concepts.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin working on the C++ Learning Modules, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++) to compile your code.
- The `make` utility to manage the build process for each exercise.

## Getting Started

To get started with each exercise, follow these general steps:

1. Navigate to the exercise directory.

   ```
   cd exercise_directory
   ```

2. Use the `make` command to compile the exercise.

   ```
   make
   ```

3. Run the compiled program with the necessary parameters.

   ```
   ./exercise_program parameters
   ```
