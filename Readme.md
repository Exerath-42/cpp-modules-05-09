# C++ Modules 05-09

Welcome to the C++ Learning Modules project! The goal of these modules is to introduce you to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using the C++ programming language. This project marks the starting point of your C++ journey, and it's designed to provide a solid foundation in OOP concepts.

## Getting Started

To get started with each exercise, follow these general steps:

1. Navigate to the exercise directory.

   ```
   cd exercise_directory
   ```

2. Use the `make` command to compile the exercise.

   ```
   make
   ```

3. Run the compiled program with the necessary parameters.

   ```
   ./exercise_program parameters
   ```
